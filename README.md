# ChatSeal
App for delivering secure chat over Twitter using steganography, built in the
iOS4-7 timeframe.  It was published and in the App Store for a brief period and
worked successfully with Twitter feeds as a transport protocol.

Everything here is of my own invention and independent work unless otherwise no
noted by an alternative license (eg. libPNG for testing).  References to 
'RealProven, LLC' are to my own company.

The code and ideas are under copyright by me and _only_ provided for
